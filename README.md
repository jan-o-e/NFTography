# NFTography
Platform for authentic and original photography. Ownership is certified with NFT tokens which are minted upon uploading. Original photos are uploaded and stored on the IPFS to prevent fraud and a complete transactional history of the NFT is available to view on the blockchain. The aim is to provide a decentralized platform to protect content creators and counteract copyright infringements and fraud.
