# NFTography
Platform for authentic and original photography. Ownership of photographs is certified with NFT tokens which are minted upon uploading an image which cannot exist anywhere else in the web pre-upload. Provably original photos are uploaded and stored on IPFS to prevent NFT related fraud fraud and a complete transactional history of the NFT is available to view on the blockchain. The aim is to provide a decentralized platform to protect content creators and counteract copyright infringements and fraud. 

Trading and royalty distribution is also managed on NFTography. NFT owners can sell their NFT's and thereby pass on all rights associated with the underlying photograph, but granting royalty free access to others is also possible and can be authorized with an eth transaction which provides a hash of the NFT and the IPFS CID in the transactional data. All of the access grants are thus publicly visible on the blockchain.
