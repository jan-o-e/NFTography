# NFTography
Platform for authentic and original photography. Ownership of photographs is certified with NFT tokens which are minted upon uploading an image which cannot exist anywhere else in the web pre-upload. Provably original photos are uploaded and stored on IPFS to prevent NFT related fraud fraud and a complete transactional history of the NFT is available to view on the blockchain. The aim is to provide a decentralized platform to protect content creators and counteract copyright infringements and fraud. 

Trading and royalty distribution is also managed on NFTography. NFT owners can access the full image, but others can only see a watermarked copy.
